## Intro

We've already created the search bar box in the navbar. Now it's time to make it functional.

Here's what we have:

```
            <div className='search-wrapper'>
                <div className='search-field'>
                    <input
                        type='text'
                        placeholder='Search generators'
                        label="Search generators"
                    >
                    </input>
                    <button><FontAwesomeIcon icon="magnifying-glass" /> Search</button>
                </div>
            </div>
```

We'll transform this into a component of its own (the styles will remain in the navbar stylesheet though), and will later render this in the navbar.

```
import React, { UseState, UseEffect } from 'react';
import axios from "axios"

export default function SearchBar({ data }) {
    return (
        <div className='search-wrapper'>
            <div className='search-field'>
                <input
                    type='text'
                    placeholder='Search generators'
                    label="Search generators"
                >
                </input>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

> We're using a functional component because we need to wrap render divs inside js code, and this cannot be done with class components because the render method is separated from the logic of the app. However, we can work with state if we import ``UseState`` from React, as well as using the equivalent of ```ComponentDidMount``, which is ``UseEffect``.

> Put labels doubling the placeholders' texts. Labels are legible by screen readers while placeholders are not.

> Removed the search button because we won't need it, the results will appear as we type.

## Displaying results

We want the results to display on screen as we type, so we'll add another field to the searchbar, but first we need to call axios to get the data, and mount that in order to later on render content on the screen:

```
const SearchBar = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        const getData = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await axios.get("https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/tables")
                setData(response.data);
                setFilteredData(response.data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.log("An error happened", error)
            }
        }

        getData();
    }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs once after initial render
```

Here we're calling axios and later calling in the function that calls it (getData) inside the useEffect function, thus mounting it. We also setState with data and filteredData, populating the state. Now we'll display the data in the render section of the component:

```
<div className="search-results">
                    {filteredData.length !== 0 ? (
                        filteredData.map(item => (
                            <SingleItem
                                key={item.item_id}
                                item_id={item.item_id}
                                title={item.item_title}
                                content={item.item_content}
                                slug={item.item_title}
                                category={item.item_category}
                            />
```

Here we're mapping the data and returning the SingleItem component, repeating the process of the **item-container.js** file.

Now all the items appear below the searchbar, but we don't want this to appear always, just when the user is typing in.

## Searchbar logic

Continuing with the search bar, we need a new handler that filters data as well as two more states. So we get this:

```
const [data, setData] = useState([]);
const [filteredData, setFilteredData] = useState([]);
const [enteredWord, setEnteredWord] = useState("");

(...)

const handleFilter = (event) => {
        const SearchedWord = event.target.value
        setEnteredWord(searchedWord);
        const newFilter = data.filter(item => {
            return item.item_title.toLowerCase().includes(searchedWord.toLowerCase());
        });
        setFilteredData(newFilter);
    };
```

*SearchedWord* points to the typed value, and is later setting state as it's stored in setEnteredWord. *NewFilter* calls the data state and returns item titles' that include the *SearchedWord* and converts everything to lowercase so that the search bar isn't case-sensitive. Finally, *NewFilter* is stored inside the *filteredData* state via *setFilteredData*. So now we have to change the data calling to *filteredData*.

## Showing the div when typing in

We want to show the results only when the user types in. To do so, we'll add a conditional to the search-results div:

```
{enteredWord && (
        <div className="search-results">
            {filteredData.length !== 0 ? (
              filteredData.slice(0, 10).map(item =>
                  <SingleItem
                      key={item.item_id}
                      item_id={item.item_id}
                      title={item.item_title}
                      content={item.item_content}
                      slug={item.item_title}
                      category={item.item_category}
                  />
              ))
          ) : (
              <p>No results found. Do you want to <NavLink to="/create" className="link">create</NavLink> one?</p>
          )}
      </div>
    )}
```

This code checks for the data in EnteredWord (which was set by setEnteredWord, which in turn stores SearchedWord, which pointed to event.target.value). If there's data, the div is shown and inside it another conditional checks for the filteredData's (which was set by setFilteredData) length. If it's not equal to 0 (in other words, if content is typed) it shows the looping through the items (returning SingleItems) (and shows up to 10 items in order to don't load everything at once), and if it doesn't find coincidences displays a results not found message.

## Positioning missaligned items

Right now, the result div missaligns the CSS. To fix this, we must set ``position: relative`` in the search wrapper:

```
.search-wrapper {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        position: relative;
```

And in the search results div, ``position: absolute`` and the top, bottom, left or right property along with its value.

```
.search-results {
        width: 26.5vw;
        max-height: 12vh;
        background-color: $SearchBar;
        overflow: hidden;
        overflow-y: auto;
        position: absolute;
        top: 80%;
```
