## First steps

Now, in the **creation-manager.js** file, we know that we'll have to update the state because we'll create new items when we hit the submit button. To do that we'll pass functions as props. First, we'll create a couple of methods that handle successful or unsuccessful submissions:

```
this.handleSuccessfulFormSubmission = this.handleSuccessfulFormSubmission.bind(this)
this.handleFormSubmissionError = this.handleFormSubmissionError.bind(this)


    handleSuccessfulFormSubmission(item) {

    }

    handleFormSubmissionError(error) {
        console.log('handleFormSubmissionError error', error);
    }
```

And now we'll pass them as props to the **generator-form.js** file:

```
<div className="creation-manager-wrapper">
    <div className="upper-part-wrapper">
        <GeneratorForm
            handleSuccessfulFormSubmission={this.handleSuccessfulFormSubmission}
            handleFormSubmissionError={this.handleFormSubmissionError} />
    </div>
```

In **generator-form.js** we'll create state inside, because the values will be changing.

```
this.state = {
    item_title: "",
    item_category: "",
    item_content: "",
```

Now we'll update the form inputs. Remember that the input names (the values) must be matching the state keys.

```
<form>
    <input
        type="text"
        name="item_title"
        placeholder="Generator name"
        value={this.state.item_title}
        onChange={this.handleChange}
    />
    <select
        name="item_category"
        value={this.state.item_category}
        onChange={this.handleChange}
    >
        <option value="characters">Characters</option>
        <option value="objects">Objects</option>
        <option value="quests">Quests</option>
        <option value="skills">Skills</option>
        <option value="world">World</option>
        <option value="other">Other</option>
    </select>
    <div>
        <textarea
            type="text"
            name='item_content'
            placeholder="Write your generator's content here. Use commas (,) to separate values, please."
            value={this.state.item_content}
            onChange={this.handleChange}>
        </textarea>
    </div>
</form>
<button type="submit">Save generator</button>

```

As for the handleChange method, it will update the state when the user types something in. We'll create that below the constructor. This will allow the user to type content in, otherwise won't be possible.

```
handleChange(event) {
        this.setState({
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        });
    }
```

The handleSubmit method's preventDefault won't reload the page when the form is submitted in, and we'll pass the method to the form:

```
handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
}

<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
```

## FormData objects

FormData Objects allow us to work with non-text objects, such as images. In the **generator-form.js** file we're going to create a function called BuildForm(), just below the bindings and above the handlers. Inside this function we're going to create the FormData object. Inside of there we'll add data points using the append method:

```
buildForm() {
        let formData = new FormData();

        formData.append("Item[item_title]", this.state.item_title);
        formData.append("Item[item_content]", this.state.item_content);
        formData.append("Item[item_category]", this.state.item_category);


        if (this.state.item_title) {
            formData.append("Item[item_title]", this.state.item_title);
        }

        if (this.state.item_content) {
            formData.append("Item[item_content]", this.state.item_content);
        }

        if (this.state.item_category) {
            formData.append("Item[item_category]", this.state.item_category);
        }

        return formData;
    }
```

The append method takes two arguments: The first is going to be a string and it's going to be the string and structure that our API expects. Then, we pass in the state. Now we're ready to connect to the API, but we need to call that method inside the handleSubmit method.

## Connecting to the API

We can connect to the API and create records from the form that will be submitted to the API. In the handleSubmit method, we'll call Axios and pass the buildForm method and the withCredentials object.

```
handleSubmit(event) {
        axios.post(
            "https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/create",
            this.buildForm(),
            { withCredentials: true, headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } })
            .then(response => {
                console.log("response", response)
            }).catch(error => {
                console.log("Something went wrong", error)
            })
        event.preventDefault();
    }
```

We're using FormData objects, and that requires some changes to the backend route. So the route changes to this (request.form.get instead of request.json):

```
@app.route("/create", methods=['POST', 'OPTIONS'])
def add_item():
    if request.method == 'OPTIONS':
        # Handle the preflight request
        response = jsonify({'status': 'preflight successful'})
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true')
        return response, 200
    
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        title = request.form.get("Item[item_title]")
        category = request.form.get("Item[item_category]")
        content = request.form.get("Item[item_content]")

        new_item_instance = Item(title, category, content)

        db.session.add(new_item_instance)
        db.session.commit()

        item = Item.query.get(new_item_instance.item_id)
        return item_schema.jsonify(item)
```


## Small bug correction

**generator-form.js** has a small bug in it. That bug is that even though our form begins with a default value for the category, when we hit save, no category is getting pushed up.

The select tag only works when it's been changed (because it has the handleChange method on it), and because the default state is empty. To fix this, we can simply update the string with a default value:

```
this.state = {
    item_title: "",
    item_category: "Characters",
    item_content: "",
```

This way, the constructor is going to run when the class is initiated.

## Connect the form with the manager

Now we'll create a feature that connects the form with the sidebar so when we create a new record from the form it appears on the manager's lower part.

In the **creation-manager.js** file we're going to copy the handleSuccessfulFormSubmission portion and paste it in the handleSubmit's then promise (inside the generator-form, which recieves props from **creation-manager**). From there, we'll update state with the item that's created by the **GeneratorList** calling, inside the portfolio manager itself, and will concatenate to that the state itself. Now the items will appear in the manager.

```
<div className="lower-part-wrapper">
   {this.state.randomGeneratorList.map(item => {
       return (<GeneratorList key={item.item_id} data={item} />)
   })}
(...)

handleSuccessfulFormSubmission(item) {
        this.setState({
            randomGeneratorList: [item].concat(this.state.randomGeneratorList)
        })
    }
```

## Deleting form data when clicking submit

When we create an item the form remains written. We'll create a function to delete the fields when we hit submit, and we'll do that in the handleSubmit method, in the then portion, to set the state to its default.

```
handleSubmit(event) {
        axios.post(
            "https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/create",
            this.buildForm(),
            { withCredentials: true, headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } })
            .then(response => {
                this.props.handleSuccessfulFormSubmission(response.data)
                this.setState({
                    item_title: "",
                    item_category: "Characters",
                    item_content: "",
                })
```
