## Adding route guards

The unlogged user won't be able to see the random generator creation page or the profile one. We need to hide those routes to them, and show them only when the user is authenticated.

We'll pass the LoginStatus state from the **app.js** file to the **navbar.js** file:

```
<Navbar LoggedInStatus= {this.state.LoginStatus} />
```

And now, in the **navbar.js** file, we'll use a ternary operator that displays the Create and Profile pages when the user is logged in: 

```
{props.LoggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN" ?
       <NavLink exact to="/create" className="link" activeClassName="active-link"><FontAwesomeIcon icon='magic-wand-sparkles' /> Create</NavLink> : null}

{props.LoggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN" ?
    <NavLink exact to="/users/:slug" className="link" activeClassName="active-link"><FontAwesomeIcon icon='id-card' /> Profile</NavLink> : null}
```

## Using a ternary operator to turn the login button into a log out button when we're logged in

We need to tell the user that they're logged in, and to do so we need to change the log in button of the navbar to a log out one to show up when they're logged in. To do so, we'll use a ternary operator.

```
    {props.LoggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN" ?
    <button><NavLink exact to="/login" className="link"><FontAwesomeIcon icon="right-from-bracket" /> Log out </NavLink></button>
    :
    <button><NavLink exact to="/login" className="link"><FontAwesomeIcon icon="circle-user" /> Log in </NavLink></button>}
            </div>
```

## Effectively hiding links

When showing and hiding links the routes aren't affected and we can still go to them. Now we're going to change that, and unlogged users won't be able to see them. In the **app.js** file, we'll create another function:

```
 AuthorisedPages() {
    return [
      <Route exact path="/create" component={CreatePage} />,
      <Route exact path="/users/:slug" component={ProfilePage} />
    ]
  }
```

From there, we only have to do a ternary operator and call in the array index:

```
{this.state.LoginStatus == "LOGGED_IN" ? this.AuthorisedPages()[0] : null}
{this.state.LoginStatus == "LOGGED_IN" ? this.AuthorisedPages()[1] : null}
```

Now the pages redirect to the error page when we're unlogged.

> Refresh the web page to unlog.

> Note: Don't refresh and log in inmediately or the server will go down.
