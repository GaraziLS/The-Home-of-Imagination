## Adding the buttons

In the **generator-list.js** file, we're going to add a couple of buttons.

```
import React from 'react';

const GeneratorList = (props) => {
    const RawData = props.data;
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{RawData.item_id}</h1>
            <h2>{RawData.item_title}</h2>

            <button>Edit</button>
            <button>Delete</button>

        </div>
    );

};

export default GeneratorList;
```

The delete button will have a handler that will trigger on click. It's passed down by the **creation-manager** file, we'll create it later.

```
<button onClick={() => props.handleDeleteItem(RawData)}>Delete</button>
```

> We're passing RawData because in generator-list the data is stored there.

Now we'll create that delete function in **creation-manager.js**, and pass it down to the **generator-list.js** file:

## Delete handler

```
handleDeleteItem(item) {
        console.log("deleted item", item)
    }

    <div className="lower-part-wrapper">
        {this.state.randomGeneratorList.map(item => {
            return (<GeneratorList key={item.item_id} data={item} handleDeleteItem={this.handleDeleteItem} /> )
    })}
```

With this, we can now call axios:

```
 handleDeleteItem(item) {
        console.log("Deleting item with ID:", item.item_id);
        axios.delete(`https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/tables/${item.item_id}`, { withCredentials: true })
            .then(response => {
                console.log("delete response", response)
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.log("error deleting", error)
            });
    };
```

> We pass down item because that's the name we're iterating in the state items:

```
 <div className="lower-part-wrapper">
    {this.state.randomGeneratorList.map(item => {
    return (<GeneratorList key={item.item_id} data={item} handleDeleteItem={this.handleDeleteItem} /
```

## Removing items from state

Now the items are deleted, but not removed from the state. We have to remove that record from the state. When the response comes back, we're going to iterate over the state items and remove that record from the state. Inside of the delete handler's promise, we'll set state. Inside the state that we're setting, we're actually going to iterate and build a new collection on the fly and we're gonna use the filter function to do that.

```
 .then(_response => {
    this.setState({
    randomGeneratorList: this.state.randomGeneratorList.filter(item => {
        return item.id !== item.id;
        })
    });
 })
 ```

> There's an issue where the page goes blank after deleting an item. The filter creates a new array with all but it checks item.id !== item.id, which will always evaluate to false because it is comparing the same property of the same object with an if not equal, which is impossible because they're the same object so it will always return false. This causes the filter to return an empty array, because it removes all items being removed from the state, which is why the page goes blank.

```
.then(_response => {
    this.setState({
    randomGeneratorList: this.state.randomGeneratorList.filter(i => i.item_id !== item.item_id)
    });
})
```

So the filter, in the return statement, if it finds a record and the item.id is not equal to the ID right here that we want to delete, then we return that or in other words we keep those records and get rid of the one record that has that ID.

We now can delete items.
