If we don't want to let the users resize text areas, you can just adjust the box to the desired size and then apply the CSS property of ``resize: none``.

## FAQ Accordion

In the about page there's a collapsible menu feature, as well as in the homepage. I did it using [this library](https://primereact.org/accordion/).
