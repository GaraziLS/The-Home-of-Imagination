## Login form auth

## Adding state and more params to the form

Both forms handle state, and change it while the user is typing. We'll add state inside the forms (it will start empty):

```
export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            username: "",
            password: ""
        }
    }  
} 
```

Now we need to add an event handler to the form:

```
<form onSubmit={}>
```

Inside the curly brackets we're going to pass a function **WITH NO PARENTHESES** to avoid errors:

```
<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
```

> We'll create the function later.

Now, we'll add more params to each input because we need to keep track of the value, as well as the changes. So our code from above would become this:

**Log in form**

```
<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
       <input>
           type="text"
           name="username"
           placeholder="Type your username"
            onChange={this.handleLoginChange}>
           onChange={this.handleLoginChange}>
       </input>

       <input
           type="password"
           name="password"
           placeholder="Type your password"
           value={this.state.password || ""}
           onChange={this.handleLoginChange}>
       </input>
   </form>
   <button type="submit">Login</button>
```

> The value property calls the state or remains null. This is done to avoid conflicts between controlled and uncontrolled components.

## Change handler

Now we're going to create the handleLoginChange, which will update the state when the user types something in. We'll create that below the constructor. This will allow the user to type content in, otherwise won't be possible.

```
handleLoginChange(event) {
        this.setState({
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        });
    }
```

This code receives an event and sets state. The event.target name is set to distinguish between the state elements, to know which is which (if the user types in the password field the target will be the password, and so on). The [] are used to note that this is an expression and not a string.

> We must bind the handler to the ``this`` keyword in order to call it properly, so we'll type ``this.handleLoginChange = this.handleLoginChange.bind(this);``. We should get this:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            email: "",
            password: ""
        };

        this.handleLoginChange = this.handleLoginChange.bind(this);
    }

    handleLoginChange(event) {
        this.setState({
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        });
    }

    render {...}
```

## Submit handler

Remember the handleSubmit method of the form? We'll work on that now. The handler will be above the Change handler, and we'll bind that as well.

```
this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);

handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault()
    }
```

## Connecting to the API

We need to connect to the backend in order to log in or sign up. To do so, we need axios, so we'll import it.

```
import axios from "axios"
```

We'll add the following lines to the handleSubmit method:

```
handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        axios.post('https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/login', {
            user_name: this.state.username,
            user_password: this.state.password
        }, { withCredentials: true })
            .then(response => {
                console.log('logged in', response);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.log("Wrong username or password", error);
            });
    }
```

Now we'll go to the backend, to the **app.py** file and for clarity we'll do its documentation here.

We'll add some lines that contain CORS configurations to the login endpoint to avoid CORS blocking (because the ports are different domains), so we get this:

```
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST", "OPTIONS"])
def user_login():
    if request.method == 'OPTIONS':
        # Handle the preflight request
        response = jsonify({'status': 'preflight successful'})
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS')
        response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true')
        return response, 200
    
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle the actual POST request
        user_name = request.json["user_name"]
        user_password = request.json["user_password"]
        user = User.query.filter_by(user_name=user_name).first()

        if user and user.user_password == user_password:
            response = jsonify({'message': 'Login successful'})
            response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000')
            response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true')
            return response, 200
        else:
            response = jsonify({"Warning": "Wrong username or password"})
            response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000')
            response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true')
            return response, 401
```

## Error handling

We've everything (error catching included) ready, but we need to notify the user if they put wrong credentials in.
To do so, we'll go to the **login_component.js** file and will add another piece to the initial state:

```
 this.state = {
    username: '',
    password: '',
    errorText: ''
 }
```

And now, we're going to call it right above the form:

```
 render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Log in</h2>
                <div>{this.state.errorText}</div>

                <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
```

However, it is empty. We'll have to set state inside the catch portion of the promise, one for 401 status (wrong username or password) and one for a 500 status (API down). So the entire route goes like this:

```
handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        axios.post('https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/login', {
            user_name: this.state.username,
            user_password: this.state.password
        }, { withCredentials: true })
            .then(response => {
                if (response.status === 200) {
                    console.log("Successful log in", response)
                }
            })
            .catch(error => {
                if (error.response || error.response.status === 401) {
                    this.setState({
                        errorText: "Wrong username or password"
                    })
                } else {
                    this.setState({
                        errorText: "It seems that the server is down. Please, try again later."
                    })
                }
            }
        )
    }
```

Now we need to get rid of that error because it needs to be gone when our actions change. It would be useless to display a wrong credentials message when they're correct, or a server down notification when it's not.

So we'll go to the handleLoginChange method to just reset the state:

```
handleLoginChange(event) {
        this.setState({
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        })
        this.setState({
            errorText: ""
        });
    }
```

Thus, when writing in the fields the warning will be gone.

## Login logic

Now that the login works, we need to start working on what happens when the user logs in, such as being able to create, update and items in the *Create* page, and delete their account in the profile. Doing this won't be possible if the user isn't logged in.

We'll start in the frontend, in the **app.js** file, to add an initial state as well as props to the constructor:

```
 export default class App extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            LoginStatus: 'NOT_LOGGED_IN'
        };
    }
```

Now we'll create two methods that will set state, one for successful logins and the other for unsuccessful attempts, still in the **app.js** file:

```
export default class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      LoginStatus: "NOT_LOGGED_IN"
    }

    Icons()

    // Bindings

    this.handleSuccessfulLogin = this.handleSuccessfulLogin.bind(this)
    this.handleUnSuccessfulLogin = this.handleUnsuccessfulLogin.bind(this)
  }

  handleSuccessfulLogin() {
    this.setState({
      LoginStatus: "LOGGED_IN"
    });
  }

  handleUnsuccessfulLogin() {
    this.setState({
      LoginStatus: "NOT_LOGGED_IN"
    });
  }
```

We're going to use these methods via render props. A render prop is a prop passed to a component but that's able to communicate with the render method.

> The steps that we will follow now are in the **react-router documentation**.

We'll work in the route section:

```
<Route exact path="/login" component={LoginPage} />
```

We'll delete the LoginPage component to pass render props in, and then the component itself.

```
<Route exact path="/login"
        render={props => (
        <LoginPage/>
    )}
```

From the inline LoginPage component we're going to pass props, but first we must use the spread operator {...} and pass in props. From there we'll add the handlers.

```
<Route exact path="/login"
     render={props => (
     <LoginPage
       {...props}
       handleSuccessfulLogin={this.handleSuccessfulLogin}
       handleUnSuccessfulLogin={this.handleUnsuccessfulLogin} />
   )}
/>
```

Now we'll go to the **login.js** file and pass in props to the constructor to use the handlers there:

```
export default class Login extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
```

And now, we'll build two new handlers that will call **handleSucessfulLoginAuth** (that redirects to the homepage) and **handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth**.

```
export default class Login extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.handleSuccessfulLoginAuth = this.handleSuccessfulLoginAuth.bind(this);
        this.handleUnsuccessfuLoginlAuth = this.handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth.bind(this);
    }

    handleSuccessfulLoginAuth() {
        this.props.handleSuccessfulLogin();

        // redirect user to home page
        this.props.history.push('/');
    }

    handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth() {
        this.props.handleUnsuccessfulLogin();
    }
```

Now we'll modify the LoginComponent calling itself to pass these props in:

```
render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <LoginComponent
                    handleSuccessfulLoginAuth={this.handleSuccessfulLoginAuth}
                    handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth={this.handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth} />
            </div>
        );
```

And now we only have to modify the **login_component.js** file.

```
handleSubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        axios.post('https://devcamp-fullstack-project-backend.onrender.com/login', {
            user_name: this.state.username,
            user_password: this.state.password
        }, { withCredentials: true })
            .then(response => {
                if (response.status === 200) {
                    this.props.handleSuccessfulLoginAuth();
                }
            })
            .catch(error => {
                if (error.response || error.response.status === 401) {
                    this.setState({
                        errorText: "Wrong username or password"
                    })
                    this.props.handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth();
                } else {
                    this.setState({
                        errorText: "It seems that the server is down. Please, try again later."
                    })
                    this.props.handleUnsuccessfulLoginAuth();
                }
            }
            )
    }
``` 

## Calling the API to see if the user is authenticated or not

We'll now call the API for it to check if the user is logged in or not because when we reload the page the page unlogs the user out. In the **app.js** file, we'll create a new method, but we first need to create a new route that gets the user data in the backend:

```
@app.route("/logged_in", methods="GET") 
def getLoginData():
    return user_login()
```

Now, for the method in the app.js file:

```
 checkLoginStatus() {
    return axios
      .get("https://api.devcamp.space/logged_in", {
        withCredentials: true
      })
      .then(response => {
        const loggedIn = response.data.logged_in;
        const loggedInStatus = this.state.loggedInStatus;

        if (loggedIn && loggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN") {
          return loggedIn;
        } else if (loggedIn && loggedInStatus === "NOT_LOGGED_IN") {
          this.setState({
            loggedInStatus: "LOGGED_IN"
          });
        } else if (!loggedIn && loggedInStatus === "LOGGED_IN") {
          this.setState({
            loggedInStatus: "NOT_LOGGED_IN"
          });
        }
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log("Error", error);
      });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.checkLoginStatus();
  }
  ```
